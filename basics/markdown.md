# Blob

### The Blob in Cryptocurrency Mining

The "blob" is a crucial concept in RandomX mining, serving as the primary input for the hashing function. It's a byte string that contains essential information about the block being mined.

Monero Blob Example: A typical Monero blob might look like this (in hexadecimal):

```
1017e6bdfedc053771512f1bc3a7c1730005b179634c9d39701b2b2d10401005ff8eaf3a7b2e0169a54f11269ed2c97af9bc7de4cb82f97e3064f8b390cc5d907
```

As you can see it's a 76bytes string that is generated by hashing a Monero Block template.\
Etica doesn't generate the blob from a block template but the resulting blob is exactly same format as Monero RandomX blobs.

#### Etica Blob Structure:

Here is an example of an Etica Blob:

```

#### Nonce

When miners receive the blob, their mining software iterates by replacing the bytes at a certain position (it is named the nonceOffset). \
_**In Monero and Etica the NonceOffset is at position 39bytes and has a size of 4bytes.**_



#### ReservedSpace

In the RandomX system it is important that each miner receives a specific Blob, not all miners mine on the same Blob. In order to generate specific blobs there is a ReservedSpace\
Reserved Space (55-62 bytes):

* 8 bytes reserved for miner-specific data
* This is where the truncated extraNonceHash is inserted



Etica's implementation of RandomX uses a blob structure inspired by Monero but tailored to its own blockchain requirements. Here's a breakdown of the Etica blob:
